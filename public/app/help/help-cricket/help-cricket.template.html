  <h4 class="card-title">Fridge</h4>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    Purple-colored and green-colored phage strains in the fridge are provided at the beginning of each scenario.
    Green-color phage are reference strains where the genotype is known.
    Purple-colored phage have unknown genotype. It is often the task of the scenario.

<p class="card-text px-3">
    Clicking on the “…” symbol next to the strain allows you to gain more information about the strain.</p>

<div id="labroom" class="my-2">
  <h4 class="card-title">Lab Room</h4>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    The lab room is where experiments are performed to solve your phage genetics question.
  </p>
  <h5 class="card-subtitle mt-2">B and K strain <i>E. coli</i></h5>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
  In the lab room, there are B and K strain E. coli provided for your experiments.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
  <span class="text-info">B strain:</span> When this strain of <i>E. coli</i>
  is plated with wildtype phage, the wildtype phage will produce small plaques on the
    plate. When B strain is plated with mutant phage, the phage will produce large plaques.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
  <span class="text-danger">K strain:</span> When this strain of <i>E. coli</i>
  is plated with wildtype phage, the wildtype phage will produce small plaques on the
    plate. Mutant phage do not produce any plqaues on this strain.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
Understanding the properties of B and K strain <i>E. coli</i> will help you to choose the best strain for your particular experiment.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
What is a plaque? A plaque is a circular clearing of bacterial growth on the plate.
Imagine that when we plate E. coli, the bacterial growth forms a lawn on the plate that fills the entire plate.
Plaques occur when phage attack and kill E. coli, resulting in these circular clearings.
  </p>

  <h5 class="card-title mt-2">Plating a phage strain</h5>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    To plate a strain of phage, first click your chosen phage strain in the fridge
    then click the test tube containing the <i>E. coli</i> strain of your choice.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    Here, we have incubated Phage Strain 1 with <span class="text-danger">K strain</span> <i>E. coli</i>.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    Next, click the <i>E. coli</i> test tube then click the 1:10<sup>1</sup> serial dilution tube.
    This will create a dilution of your <i>E. coli</i> culture.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    The dilution you should choose depends on the question you are trying to investigate.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    To further dilute your sample, you can click the 1:10<sup>1</sup> serial dilution then click the adjacent tube to create a 1:10<sup>2</sup> dilution.
    You can make serial dilutions up to 1:10<sup>4</sup>.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    To plate your sample, click the dilution of your choice then click the plate.
    Here, we will plate the 1:10<sup>4</sup> dilution.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    This is our plating result. On the plate, we see 100 small plaques and 0 large plaques.
  </p>

  <h5 class="card-title mt-2">Storing a Phage Strain from a Plate</h5>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    If you wish to store a phage strain from the plate, simply click the number corresponding with the plaque size you wish to store
    then click on an empty spot in the fridge.
    The newly stored phage strain is black in color.
  </p>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    Note that if you need more storage in the fridge, there are arrow buttons at the bottom of fridge that will provide more space for storing phage.
  </p>

  <h5 class="card-title mt-2">Crossing Phage</h5>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    If you wish to cross to phage strains together, click then drop both strains separately into the <i>E. coli</i> strain of your choice.
    You will see both phage incubating in the test tube. You can then make serial dilutions and plate them to observe the results of the cross.
  </p>
</div> <!-- end labroom -->

<div id="plexer" class="my-2">
  <h4 class="card-title">Plexer</h4>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    The Plexer is useful for crossing a large number of phage strains at the same time.
</p>
<p class="card-text px-3">
    To use the Plexer, drag and drop the phage you want to cross into the darkened boxes. Then, select which E. coli strain you would like to use. If you desire, you can change the dilution value. Then, press submit.
</p>
<p class="card-text px-3">
    The results will appear beneath your phage strain and will look similar to the results we see from plates in the main lab room. You are unable to store phage strains produced from the Plexer in the fridge.
</p>
</div> <!-- end #plexer -->

<div id="model" class="my-2">
  <h4 class="card-title">Model</h4>
  <p class="card-text px-3">
    The Model is useful for mapping deletions.
    Strain numbers in the modeller match strain numbers in the fridge.
    To add a deletion to the modeler, click on the boxes corresponding to the phage you are studying. Deletions can be any length.
